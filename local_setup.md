# setting up locally

## requirements
- nodejs
having node means you have python installed, so I wont bother listing


## first steps

```
git clone git@github.com:abschill/cookiedough-cli
cd cookiedough-cli
```

```
yarn setup
```
this will enable x permissions on the scripts dir and get you up and running with the installation/build

```
yarn run:help
```

test the help page to see if your local installation is running properly
